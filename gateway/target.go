// ID is a stable, secret-free diagnostic identity used for logs and
// metrics only: it is never sent upstream and is not a substitute for
// Model's own identity (Model.Key). An empty ID asserts no diagnostic
// identity and is a valid configuration.
//
// Client is already bound to its own credentials and connection policy --
// the gateway never handles secrets directly, so Client must never be nil.
//
// Model is the secret-free model descriptor sent with each request routed
// to this target.
