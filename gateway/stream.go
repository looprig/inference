// Package gateway (this file) implements Handler.serveStreaming: the
// incremental pull loop that drives a streaming inference response.
//
// serveStreaming replaces the intentionally minimal Task-6 stub declared in
// handler.go (see that method's remaining doc comment there for the seam
// contract: ServeHTTP's call site and the admission acquire/release around
// it are unchanged by this file). It is responsible for, in order:
//
//  1. Calling target.Client.Stream (decoded.Request.Model has already been
//     replaced with target.Model by serveInference).
//  2. Classifying a pre-header Stream error exactly like the non-streaming
//     Invoke failure path (a *UpstreamInvocationError via h.writeError).
//  3. Owning the returned *stream.StreamReader[content.Chunk] for its
//     entire lifetime once Stream succeeds (a deferred Close covers clean
//     EOF, in-stream failure, and cancellation alike).
//  4. Opening the native streaming response via sc.OpenStream -- the point
//     headers commit, after which every further failure goes through the
//     returned codec.StreamEncoder's Fail, never sc.WriteError again.
//  5. Pulling chunks one at a time and writing each to the StreamEncoder in
//     order, terminating with exactly one of Finish (clean EOF) or Fail
//     (any other error).
//  6. Arming a watcher that closes the reader when the inbound request's
//     context is canceled, so a blocked Next() cannot outlive a client
//     disconnect or server shutdown -- and disarming that watcher once the
//     pull loop itself returns, so a normal, fast request never leaves a
//     goroutine (or context bookkeeping) waiting on a longer-lived parent
//     context.

//     resolved upstream model name (mirroring serveInference's non-streaming
//     resp.Model assignment). A defensive false from reader.Result() (no
//     producer result -- not expected from a well-behaved client, but must
//     not panic or skip termination) still calls Finish, with a zero-value
//     StreamResult carrying only that same Model.
//   - a WriteChunk failure, or any other non-EOF error from Next
//     (including one surfaced by a cancellation-triggered Close racing the
//     read), calls Fail. Fail's own error, if any, is not actionable here --
//     the loop is already unwinding on failure -- so it is discarded.
